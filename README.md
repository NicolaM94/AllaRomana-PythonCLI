### Backbone Python project for LaRomana App and Desktop Util

LaRomana is a project that aim to provide a simple and efficient tool for managing costs and payouts between friends. Have you ever been on a holiday with some friends and everyone starts paying for the others to the point that nobody knows what he actually spent and what he owes to the others?

LaRomana tries to solve that, providing a simple graphic tool to create a project and add the partecipants, add the costs for each partecipant and calculate everyone credit or debt.

**NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL PROJECT, THIS IS A SIMPLE CLI FOR TESTING AND DEBUGGING PURPOSES**
